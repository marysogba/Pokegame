# Pokegame
Play Pok√©mon Top Trumps!

My final project for Code First Girls: Python Programming course involved building a Top Trumps game using Python.

The rules are simple:

Choose a statistic you wish to use against your opponent (the computer)
Type in the statistic you have chosen.
If your score is higher than your opponents, you win!
